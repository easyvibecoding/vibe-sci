"""Drop orphan `$` signs left behind by truncated LLM output.

Failure mode this targets: MiniMax / any LLM sometimes truncates an inline
equation mid-sentence, e.g.

    We compare against the ensemble variant with $

followed immediately by `\\section{Experiments}`. The unmatched `$` opens
math mode that never closes, so pdflatex fails with "Missing $ inserted"
anywhere downstream — producing a cascade of misleading errors.

We can't reliably guess what the LLM intended to write, so we don't try to
reconstruct the equation. We drop the orphan instead: outside a section the
unclosed `$` is unsalvageable prose anyway, and leaving it breaks the whole
paper. A logged warning surfaces the event so the author can fix the prose
by hand if they care about that sentence.

Scope: only considers `$` that are NOT inside a display-math or tabular
environment (those match as a whole via _MATH_BLOCK below and are preserved
verbatim). Paired `$...$` inline math is fine — we remove only the last
unmatched `$` when the count is odd.
